Project - Using Regression to Determine the Relation Between Pesticides Use and Crop Yield in the US

Description - The objective of this project is to isolate the frequency of certain pesticides and determine what may have the best effect on the yield of certain crops across the country. This will be done with a regression model that will take the little data that we have and determine how to best display what information would be worth the focus of further study.

Contents of Repository: 
  * Project Proposal
  * Final Report
  * Presentation Folder: 
    * Powerpoint slides and a video of a short presentation 
  * Semester_Project Folder: 
    * Two notebooks: 
      * project.ipynb is the main analysis of the data and the regression model (this notebook takes ~ 20 minutes to run all of the preprocessing and analysis) 
      * Past_techniques.ipynb are some old functions and methods that were not used in the final analysis 
    * USCounties folder includes all of the things for the shapefile 
    * The two main datasets (as well as the supplementary temp and rainfall datasets) were too large to be included in the repository; they are linked here: \
